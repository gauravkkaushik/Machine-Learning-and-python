# Python Parallel Programming for Beginners

A beginner-friendly notebook to understand and implement **multithreading** and **multiprocessing** in Python — tailored for data analysts, data scientists, and consultants.

## What's Inside

- What is a process? What is a thread?
- Multithreading vs. Multiprocessing (with visuals)
- When to use each (I/O-bound vs. CPU-bound)
- Simulated and real-world examples:
  - File downloads
  - Public API requests using threads
- Time comparisons and key takeaways

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Clone this repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/python-parallel-programming-for-beginners.git
cd python-parallel-programming-for-beginners
```

### Step 2: Open the notebook

Make sure you have Jupyter installed, then launch:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Open the file:  
`python_parallel_programming_for_beginners.ipynb`

> Required package:
> ```bash
> pip install requests
> ```

### Step 3: Run and Learn

- Walk through each section of the notebook
- Run both sequential and multithreaded code examples
- Observe time differences and understand real-world applications
