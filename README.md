# 🚀 Python, Data Science & Machine Learning Practice Journey

> ⚠️ **Note**: This repository assumes a basic familiarity with Python fundamentals such as control flow (if-else, loops), data structures (lists, dictionaries, sets), and writing functions. If you're completely new to Python, consider reviewing those topics before diving deeper.

Welcome to my hands-on learning repository! This space reflects my continuous journey to **learn, revise, and apply** Python programming, Data Science, and Machine Learning concepts through structured modules and real-world practice.

> 🧠 **Objective**: Strengthen my fundamentals, stay up to date with best practices, and share learnings regularly on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gauravkkaushik/) to help and inspire others in the community.
